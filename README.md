## Introduction and Motivation

In modern world, increasing technology has gained immense significance for location-based services. The ability to quickly find nearby essential locations such as **pharmacies, hotels, supermarkets, restaurants, hospitals**, and more has become an integral part of daily life. The concept of location based services has revolutionized the way individuals navigate and interact with their environment. With the development of smartphones and web applications, users now expect quick and accurate information about nearby services. Traditional maps and navigation tools have evolved into interactive platforms that provide real-time data visualization, transforming location awareness into a more engaging and informed experience.

The motivation behind the development of this R package lies in the need to empower users with a comprehensive tool to easily explore their surroundings and make decisions. Existing applications often lack customizability and are limited in terms of data visualization and downloading options. This package bridges the gap by offering a user-friendly interface that enables individuals to visualize, analyze, and utilize information about important locations within their vicinity.

### Package Overview

This R package designed to enhance location-based decision-making through interactive visualization. The package use **[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)**, a powerful open-source R package for interactive maps, **httr, jsonlite, utils, sf** and three external geographic APIs to provide current location of user’s with valuable information about their surroundings. The package’s flexible to allow users to customize basemaps according to their preferences. With options such as **[OpenStreeMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/51.33/10.45), [EsriWorldImagery](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=10df2279f9684e4a9f6a7f08febac2a9)** and **[OpenTopoMap](https://opentopomap.org/#map=5/49.023/10.020)**, users can tailor the visualization experience to suit their needs.

### Arguments:

- basemap { **OpenStreeMap , EsriWorldImagery , OpenTopoMap** }
- category { **accommodation.hotel , commercial.supermarket , catering.restaurant , catering.cafe , healthcare.pharmacy , healthcare.hospital , education.library , entertainment.cinema** }
- output_format { **csv , geojson , kml** }

**The developed R package introduces a set of functions to enhance the location-based experience for users as follows**

- **current_location:** Visualizes the user's current location on an interactive map
- **show_list:** Users can select specific types of locations, such as pharmacies, hotels, restaurants, etc. and visualize the nearest 50 locations of the selected type within a 10km 
  range. This help users in identifying the availability and proximity of essential services.

## Methodology 

### Data Description and Exploration

This package uses Google Location API and ipinfo API for obtaining the user’s current location and details of current location. This package also uses data extracted from an **[GeoAPIfy](https://www.geoapify.com/#:~:text=Geoapify%20is%20a%20feature%2Drich,%2C%20geodata%20access%2C%20and%20more.)**, which provides information about various important locations in a given geographical area. The data includes attributes such as location name, geographical coordinates, street name, and many more. The URL of the API can be customized according to the customer requirements. For this package URL was customized to 50 numbers of point’s lies within the 10km range. 

```{r}
category <- "accommodation.hotel"
longitude <- 7.6009394 # When executing computer obtain this from Google location API
latitude <- 51.956711 # When executing computer obtain this from Google location API
api_url <- paste0("https://api.geoapify.com/v2/places?categories=",
                     category,
                     "&filter=circle:",
                     longitude,",",
                     latitude,
                     ",5000&bias=proximity:",
                     longitude,",",
                     latitude,
                     "&lang=en&limit=50&apiKey=YOUR API KEY"
  )
print(api_url)
#> [1] "https://api.geoapify.com/v2/places?categories=accommodation.hotel&filter=circle:7.6009394,51.956711,5000&bias=proximity:7.6009394,51.956711&lang=en&limit=50&apiKey=YOUR API KEY"
```

Understanding the structure and content of the data is essential for maximizing the utility of the Interactive Nearest Location Visualization R package. The data exploration process provides available data attributes, their distributions, and potential patterns. Here are some key aspects of data exploration:

#### 1.	Data Attributes:

On map view, following data attributes can be seen in popups. And also these data attributes can be seen in downloaded formats (csv, geojson, kml)

- Location Name: The name of the important location, such as a specific restaurant or pharmacy.
- Latitude and Longitude: The geographic coordinates that pinpoint the location on a map.
- Distance: distance to specific location from user’s current location
- Street- Street number
- House number – House number of the location
- Postal code – Postal code for specific location
- Opening hours – Opening hours for service
- Phone number – Contact number
- Web site – Web site relevant to service

#### 2. Spatial Distribution:

Analyzing the distribution of location data on a map helps identify clusters and trends. Visualizing the spatial distribution of various location types can reveal the geographic availability of different services.

**3. Proximity Analysis and Navigation:**

By calculating the distances between the user’s current location and the nearest important locations of different types, it’s possible to understand the accessibility of various services. This analysis can highlight areas that may lack specific services within a certain radius

### R Package Development 

The development and implementation of the "nearPointR" package involves several key steps, ranging from package creation to visualization and deployment. Below is a detailed overview of the entire process.

#### 1. Initializing the Package with `create_package()`

**a. Initialize the Package:**

- Start by calling the `create_package()` function to set up a new package in a specified directory on computer. If the directory doesn't exist yet, `create_package()` will create it.

   ```r
   create_package("~/path/to/nearPointR")
   ```

**b. Leverage the `devtools` Package:**

- The `devtools` package is commonly used by R developers for creating, testing, and managing R packages. It provides a comprehensive suite of functions that simplify the package development process.

- When create a new R package using the `create_package()` function from the `devtools` package, it sets up a directory structure that includes several critical files and subdirectories. These components are vital for the organization, building, and distribution of R package.

#### 2. Key Files and Subdirectories Created by `create_package()`

- **`.Rbuildignore` and `.gitignore`:** These files help control what gets included in the final package and what is tracked by version control. `.Rbuildignore` ensures that unnecessary files are excluded during the build process, while `.gitignore` prevents certain files from being tracked by Git.

- **`DESCRIPTION`:** This file is crucial for defining the package's identity, including its name, version, author information, and dependencies. It is essential for the package's distribution and installation, as it provides the metadata that R and package management tools use to handle the package.

- **`NAMESPACE`:** The `NAMESPACE` file manages the package's interface, controlling which functions and objects are exported for use by others. It also ensures that dependencies are correctly imported and that there is no conflict with other packages.

- **`R/ Directory`:** This is where the core code of your package resides, making it the most important part of your package. All your functions, classes, and other R code will be stored here.

- **`.Rproj File and .Rproj.user Directory`:** The `.Rproj` file and `.Rproj.user` directory enhance the development experience in RStudio by managing your project-specific settings and environment. This includes configurations for your workspace, build tools, and other session-specific settings.

These files and directories are fundamental to the structure and functionality of your R package, ensuring that it is well-organized, easy to develop, and ready for distribution.

#### 3. Initialize Git with `use_git()`

Next, use the `use_git()` function to initialize a Git repository in current project directory. This function is often used alongside `devtools` during R package development.

![use_git](https://github.com/Prasadmadhusanka/Development-of-comprehensive-R-Package-for-visualization-interactive-nearest-location-using-Leaflet/blob/main/images/use_git.PNG)

#### 4. Deveploing Functions

There are five functions developed for R package as follows;

- `current_location` :	Visualizing the User's Current Location on a map using the Leaflet library
- `download_list` : 	Downloading the dataframe of Nearest Important Locations relatively User's Current Location as csv, geojson or kml format
- `navigate_to_closest` :	Navigate to the Closest Important Location relatively User's Current Location using Google map in your Web browser
- `nearest_locations` :	Visualizing the Nearest Important Locations relatively User's Current Location on a map using the Leaflet library
- `show_list` :	Showing the details of Nearest Important Locations relatively User's Current Location as dataframe

#### 5. Create R Script Files with use_r()

Next, use the use_r() function to create new R script files within your R package project. These files are stored in the R/ directory, which is the central location for all the R functions and code that form the core functionality of your package.

![use_r](https://github.com/Prasadmadhusanka/Development-of-comprehensive-R-Package-for-visualization-interactive-nearest-location-using-Leaflet/blob/main/images/use_r.png)

#### 6. Load Package with `load_all()`

The `load_all()` function from the `devtools` package is an essential tool for R package development. It simplifies the process of loading and testing  package’s functions as it work. When call `load_all()`, it loads all the functions and objects from  package’s `R/` directory directly into your R session. This allows you to test and interact with  package as if it were installed, but without the need to go through the full build and installation process.

Instead of installing the package `load_all()` lets quickly load the package code for immediate use. This is particularly useful for rapid development and testing. Each time make changes to  package code, running `load_all()` ensures that the most recent version is loaded into  R session, allowing to instantly test updates without reinstalling the package.

#### 7. Validate R Package with `check()`

Next, use the `check()` function from the `devtools` package to ensure the quality and integrity of  R package. Running `check()` helps confirm that  package meets CRAN standards and follows best practices for R package development. 

The `check()` function performs automated checks on various aspects of the package, including its structure, documentation, and code quality. It runs the same checks as `R CMD check`, the standard for package validation in R.

- **Documentation:** It verifies that all functions and datasets are properly documented, ensuring that comments are correctly converted into `.Rd` files and that all documentation fields are complete.
- **Code Quality:** It checks that code follows standard R coding practices, such as naming conventions and formatting, to maintain consistency and readability.
- **Dependencies:** It ensures that all package dependencies are correctly specified and that the package can be built and installed without any missing dependencies.

The function provides a detailed report of any errors, warnings, or notes, helping you identify and resolve issues before distributing your package.
